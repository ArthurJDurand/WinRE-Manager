How to run WinRE Manager in a managed fleet.

## Recommended model

Run `WinRE.ps1` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` from a scheduled task, triggered **at boot** and **weekly**. The script is fully idempotent; running it on a healthy machine costs a few seconds and a read-only scan.

Do **not** run it from a user logon script. It modifies partition tables and BitLocker state; those operations require SYSTEM.

## Scheduled task

Create the task with `schtasks.exe`, or as an XML payload via Group Policy / Intune.

### Via `schtasks.exe`

```cmd
schtasks /Create /TN "WinRE Manager" ^
  /TR "powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\OEM\WinRE.ps1" ^
  /SC ONSTART /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST /F

schtasks /Create /TN "WinRE Manager Weekly" ^
  /TR "powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\OEM\WinRE.ps1" ^
  /SC WEEKLY /D SUN /ST 03:00 /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST /F
